**During my internship, I developed a fully functional Weather Application as part of a hands-on project that aimed to strengthen my skills in frontend development, REST API integration, and responsive UI design. The main objective of this project was to create a user-friendly web application that provides real-time weather data based on the user’s input. The application fetches live weather information for any city entered by the user, including details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions like clouds, rain, or sunshine. Through this project, I gained valuable experience in handling third-party APIs, managing asynchronous data requests, and presenting real-time data to users in a clean and visually appealing manner.

The frontend of the application was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on simplicity, responsiveness, and interactive design. To further enhance the design and layout, I used Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework that allowed me to quickly build a modern and responsive UI without writing custom CSS from scratch. Tailwind made it easy to implement consistent spacing, layout, and color schemes, which helped in creating an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly interface that works well across different screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

To retrieve real-time weather data, I integrated the application with a public weather API, specifically the OpenWeatherMap API. This API provides current weather data in JSON format, which I fetched using JavaScript’s fetch() function. The API returns key information like temperature, humidity, wind speed, weather description, and icons representing weather conditions. I learned how to manage API keys securely, handle asynchronous data fetching using async/await functions, and parse JSON responses to display the required data dynamically on the web page. I also implemented error handling features to alert users in case of incorrect city names or network issues, ensuring a smooth and informative user experience.

For local development and testing, I used Visual Studio Code as my primary code editor and the Live Server extension to instantly preview changes in real time during development. I also used Git for version control and GitHub for code hosting and collaboration. The application was later deployed on platforms like Netlify or Vercel, making it publicly accessible from any device with an internet connection. The deployment process taught me about hosting static web apps, configuring build settings, and troubleshooting common deployment errors.

In terms of functionality, the application allows users to enter any city name, and upon submission, it fetches and displays weather data for that location in real-time. The interface dynamically updates with the temperature (in Celsius), weather description (e.g., clear sky, light rain), humidity percentage, and wind speed in km/h. I also included visual weather icons using the icon data provided by the API to make the output more intuitive. In future versions, I considered adding features such as GPS-based automatic location detection, 5-day forecasts, and dark mode toggle.

This Weather Application project provided me with a solid understanding of how modern web applications interact with external APIs and dynamically update UI components based on user input and data changes. It helped me learn how to write clean, modular JavaScript code, design responsive layouts, and implement practical features using real-world data. Through this internship, I enhanced my frontend development skills and developed the confidence to build live, data-driven web applications. Overall, this project played a significant role in preparing me for real-world development environments and full-stack project workflows.
